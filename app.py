    Welcome to the **Food Wastage Management System**!

    This project helps manage surplus food and reduce wastage by connecting **providers** with those in need.

    - üè¢ **Providers:** Restaurants, households, and businesses list surplus food.
    - üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Receivers:** NGOs and individuals claim available food.
    - üìç **Geolocation:** Helps locate nearby food efficiently.
    - üìä **SQL Analysis:** Gain powerful insights from stored data.

    Let's work together to minimize food waste and make a difference!
